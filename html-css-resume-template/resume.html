                <li>I became an Expat for the first time after completing a course 
                    to become a certified TESOL English Teacher. With a very high
                    demand in S.E. Asia. Government Contract/Thailand/Recruiter
                    /Highschool English Teacher. This was very rewarding, but it did not pay my bills so to speak.
                But by then, I wanted to stay living the Expat lifestyle. So I found contract work.</li>
                <li>Real Estate was the next Contract.</li>

        <p>Dear Company,</p>
        <p>This is where I am going to may out my journey starting
           from basically knowing nothing about coding to finding 
           a paid gig or job to keep going.</p>

        <p>First, I believe that anyone can learn to code. There are kids
            websites dedicated to this. Also, I found out that I had outdated 
            limiting beliefs about myself and the industry. I was not a math genious
            or techy in personality. If fact, this is my first real honest
            attempt at making a living using CS Skills.</p>

        <p>So far, I have started with an update on basic skills needed
            like *keyboarding/typing* skills. I was looking at job posings, and
        one of the posts asked for a copy of an exam you can take for free on typing.com</p>

        <p></p>

        <p></p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>First M. Last</p>
