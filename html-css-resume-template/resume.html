                <li>I became an expat *(digital-nomad)* for the first time working as 
                    a certified TESOL English Teacher. Hired by an agency recruiter for a
                    Thailand government contract. Highschool levels including college prep.
                    
                    This was rewarding but not financially sustainable. After a few semesters
                    I switched to Real Estate, specifically timeShare holiday membership.</li>

        <p>Dear Company,</p>
        <p>This is where I am going to map out my journey starting
           from basically knowing nothing about coding to finding 
           a paid gig. I am also trying to understand the industry
           enough to be able to find what I like or enjoy, then learning
           the skills needed to be successful at it.</p>

        <p><h1> This is where I will update my progress in this adventure of mine.</h1></p>

        <p>For keyboard and typing skills updates I use typing.com</p>

        <p>For learing about cryptocurrency and blockchain coding, I chose the Stellar Blockchain for
           ease of use and structure education available online for free uing Stellar Quest. I guess
           I would not be honest enough with you if I also failed to mention that a major German bank has 
           also chosen Stellar as their platform for the digital Euro currency. </p>

        <p>So far, other skills I am learning are here on github, Khan Academy courses, Google, redit, discord,
           and a Princeton coding course I found on Coursera for free.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Collector72 Crypto</p>
