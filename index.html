                <li>I became an expat or digital-nomad for the first time working as 
                    a certified TESOL English Teacher. Hired by an agency recruiter for a
                    Thailand government contract. I taught all highschool levels and college prep.
                    This was rewarding but not financially sustainable. After contract completions 
                    I switched to Real Estate. This branched out into lifestyle industry alternative 
                    investments such as art, property, fine-wine, crypto-currencies, and CFD trading.</li>

        <p>Dear Company,</p>
        <p>This is where I am going to map out my journey starting
           from basically knowing nothing about coding to finding 
           a paid gig. I am also trying to understand the industry
           enough to be able to find what I like or enjoy, then learning
           the skills needed to be successful at it.</p>

        <p><h1> This is where I will update my progress in this adventure of mine.</h1></p>

        <p>For keyboard and typing skills updates I use typing.com</p>

        <p>Cryptocurrency with blockchain coding: Stellar Quest.</p>

        <p>Courses and Education: GitHub, Khan Academy, Google, RedIt, Discord,
           Princeton coding course on Coursera.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Collector72 Crypto</p>
